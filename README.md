<h2> Hi, I'm Euan and i'm a developer-in-denial. </h2>
Here lies my portfolio of unfinished projects (aren't they all?). I spend a significant chunk of my spare time working on contributions towards opensource across various languages. I have zero flair for frontend development so most of my work is aimed at backend/devops. Typically, I write in Python and Golang with the occasional toe-dip into TypeScript.

When i'm feeling like a masochist, i'll try and write something in Rust.
